# Airlift Development Rules and Guidelines

## Project Context

Airlift is a Python command-line tool for uploading CSV/JSON data with attachments to Airtable. The project uses a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns across data processing, API integration, and file handling components.

## Code Organization

### Module Structure
- Keep each module focused on a single responsibility
- Use clear, descriptive module names that reflect their purpose
- Maintain consistent import patterns across modules
- Avoid circular dependencies between modules

### File Naming Conventions
- Use snake_case for all Python files and functions
- Use descriptive names that clearly indicate functionality
- Follow the existing naming pattern: `airlift_*.py` for core modules

## Coding Standards

### Python Style
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines strictly
- Use type hints for all function parameters and return values
- Implement comprehensive docstrings for public functions and classes
- Use logging instead of print statements for all output
- Keep line length under 88 characters (Black formatter standard)

### Error Handling
- Use custom exception classes from `utils_exceptions.py`
- Implement proper exception chaining with `raise ... from`
- Provide meaningful error messages to end users
- Log detailed error information for debugging
- Handle both critical and non-critical errors appropriately

### Data Processing
- Validate input data before processing
- Use UTF-8 encoding for all file operations
- Handle missing or malformed data gracefully
- Implement proper data type conversion and validation

## API Integration Patterns

### Airtable API
- Use the `new_client` class for all Airtable operations
- Implement proper authentication with Bearer tokens
- Handle API rate limits and errors gracefully
- Use structured JSON payloads for data uploads
- Validate responses and handle error codes appropriately
- Use pyairtable 3.x APIs for field creation and schema management

### Dropbox API
- Use the `dropbox_client` class for file operations
- Implement OAuth2 flow for authentication with explicit scopes
- Handle refresh token management properly
- Create organized folder structures for uploads
- Generate proper sharing URLs for attachments
- Use Dropbox SDK 12.x for latest API features and security

## CLI Development

### Argument Parsing
- Use the existing `cli_args.py` structure for argument definitions
- Group related arguments logically
- Provide clear help text for all options
- Implement proper validation for required arguments
- Use appropriate data types for argument values

### User Experience
- Provide clear progress indicators for long operations
- Use consistent logging levels (INFO, WARNING, ERROR, DEBUG)
- Implement verbose mode for detailed debugging output
- Handle user interruptions gracefully (Ctrl+C)

## Performance Considerations

### Concurrency
- Use ThreadPoolExecutor for parallel upload operations
- Implement configurable worker thread counts
- Avoid blocking operations in worker threads
- Use proper queue management for data distribution

### Memory Management
- Process data in chunks for large files
- Avoid loading entire datasets into memory
- Use generators where appropriate for data iteration
- Implement proper cleanup of resources

## Testing Guidelines

### Unit Testing
- Write tests for all public functions and classes
- Mock external API calls to avoid network dependencies
- Test both success and error conditions
- Use descriptive test names that explain the scenario

### Integration Testing
- Test end-to-end workflows with sample data
- Verify proper error handling and recovery
- Test with different file formats and sizes
- Validate API integration points

## Security Best Practices

### Authentication
- Never hardcode credentials in source code
- Use secure token storage mechanisms
- Implement proper OAuth2 flows for external services with explicit scopes
- Validate all user inputs and file paths

### Data Handling
- Sanitize all user inputs and file paths
- Use secure file upload mechanisms
- Implement proper error message sanitization
- Handle sensitive data appropriately

## Documentation Standards

### Code Documentation
- Write comprehensive docstrings for all public functions
- Include parameter types, return types, and examples
- Document any complex algorithms or business logic
- Keep documentation up to date with code changes

### User Documentation
- Maintain clear README with usage examples
- Document all command-line options and their effects
- Provide troubleshooting guides for common issues
- Keep changelog updated with all releases

## Dependencies and Packaging

### Dependency Management
- Use Poetry 2.1.3 for dependency management
- Keep dependencies up to date and secure
- Minimize external dependencies where possible
- Document any version-specific requirements
- Use identical versions to GitHub Actions workflow for reproducible builds
- Maintain Dropbox SDK 12.x for API compatibility and security

### Build and Distribution
- Maintain cross-platform compatibility
- Use PyInstaller for binary distribution
- Implement proper versioning with semantic versioning
- Test builds on all target platforms

## Ephemeral Build System

### Local Test Build Script

The project includes a comprehensive ephemeral build system (`scripts/local-test-build.sh`) that must be used for all development and testing:

#### Build System Requirements
- Always use the ephemeral build system for development
- Never install dependencies globally or modify system Python
- Keep PyInstaller out of pyproject.toml (install separately during build)
- Maintain consistency with GitHub Actions workflow
- Use system Python 3.9+ with virtual environments for isolation
- Use identical versions to GitHub Actions workflow for reproducible builds

#### Build Process Standards
- Create virtual environment in `.build/python/` directory using system Python 3.9+
- Install setuptools 80.9.0 in the virtual environment (matches GitHub Actions)
- Install Poetry 2.1.3 in the virtual environment using pip
- Install project dependencies via Poetry in `.build/venv/`
- Install PyInstaller separately in Poetry virtual environment
- Output build artifacts to `test-build/` directory
- Clean up build environment when needed

#### Directory Structure Compliance
```
Airlift/
├── .build/                    # Ephemeral build environment (gitignored)
├── test-build/               # Build output (gitignored)
├── scripts/
│   ├── local-test-build.sh  # Build script
│   └── README.md            # Usage documentation
└── ... (other project files)
```

#### Build Script Usage
- Always run from project root directory
- Use `--clean` when switching branches or after dependency changes
- Test built binary with `./test-build/airlift --help`
- Use `--update-deps` for dependency updates
- Use `--show-outdated` to check for package updates

#### CI/CD Integration Standards
- Build script must work identically in local and CI environments
- Use identical versions to GitHub Actions workflow:
  - Python 3.9+ (matches BUILD_PYTHON_VERSION: 3.9)
  - Poetry 2.1.3 (matches BUILD_POETRY_VERSION: 2.1.3)
  - Setuptools 80.9.0 (matches setuptools==80.9.0)
  - PyInstaller latest version (matches CI workflow)
  - poetry-plugin-export for requirements.txt generation
- No system-level installations or modifications
- PyInstaller installed separately (not in pyproject.toml)
- Completely ephemeral and safe for any environment
- Consistent with production build process

## Error Handling Patterns

### Exception Hierarchy
- Use `CriticalError` for fatal application errors
- Use `AirtableError` for Airtable-specific issues
- Use `TypeConversionError` for data type issues
- Implement proper exception chaining

### Logging Strategy
- Use structured logging with appropriate levels
- Include context information in log messages
- Implement file-based logging for debugging
- Use consistent log message formatting
